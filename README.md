The RPG Data System is a system that aids in the making of RPG games using the Unity engine. Specifically, itâ€™s responsible for managing data that is needed in such games. Such data can include stats, experience points (XP), level progression, and more.

Requires Unity 5.5.2 or greater. Previous versions of Unity may be supported, but not guaranteed. Please read [TheRPGDataSystem.pdf](https://github.com/JISyed/SphericalCow-UnityRpgData/blob/master/TheRPGDataSystem.pdf) to learn how to use this code.
