// Multitextured Replacement Shader with Multiply Blending
// (c) 2014 Alastair Aitchison
//
// This shader calculates the apparent brightness of each part of the game scene, and replaces
// it with a texture interpolated from a sequence of monochrome images of  progressively increasing density, which is then
// tinted with a chosen fill colour.
// The monochrome textures are encoded in the RGBA channels of a single "Replacement Texture", creating a Tonal Art Map
// see http://alastaira.wordpress.com/2013/11/01/hand-drawn-shaders-and-creating-tonal-art-maps/
// The shader is suitable for e.g. creating a hatched shading effect.

// Example use : BALLPOINT PEN material

// - First pass creates an interior mask to prevent distant faces of the object showing through transparent front faces.
// - Object is  rendered using forward rendering base pass (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/RenderTech-ForwardRendering.html)
//   which accounts for base texture lit by ambient, vertx, SH, and main directional light in scene.
// - The brightness of the resulting fragment is then used to determine the replacement fill texture
//   Increasing density is represented by RGBA channels of supplied fill texture:
//   r channel = least dense, a channel = most dense
// - Texture may be applied based on model coordinates or screen coordinates, based on SCREEN_ALIGNED definition
// - The replacement texture is tinted based on _FillColour parameter
// - Final result is blended onto the screen using multiplicative blending (Blend SrcAlpha OneMinusSrcAlpha). This has the
//   effect of darkening the existing image, much like drawing ink over a coloured picture would.
//
